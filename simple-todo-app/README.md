# 📝 Todo App (React)

A simple and mobile-friendly **Todo List Application** built using **React** and **plain CSS** as part of my **React Learning Journey**.

This project demonstrates how to manage state using React hooks and how to persist data using the browser’s `localStorage`.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User enters a task and clicks **Add**
2. Task is stored in React state (`useState`)
3. Todos are saved in `localStorage`
4. On page reload, todos are loaded from `localStorage`
5. UI updates automatically based on state changes
